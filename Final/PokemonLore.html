        <h1>General Lore and Mythos</h1>

        <p>The stages of the pokemon mythos are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The creation of the universe. Time, Space, and Antimatter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Earth is created and protected.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pangea gets split apart from via the golems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Life comes to be and so does death. There must be balance.
            </li>
            <li>
                Knowledge, Emotions, Willpower. These are what drive Humans to survive.
            </li>
            <li>
                Truth, Ideals, and the absence of both. One can not exist without the others.
            </li>
            <li>
                Disasters and the preventions and/or corrections. 
            </li>
            and
            <li>
                This thing just wanted to interact with humanity so it did.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Then there were all of the man-made legends/mythicals.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the beninging, there was just void and an egg. From that egg, hatched <a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/arceus#dex-flavor">Arceus</a> (pronounced Ark-ee-us or Ark-ooz). Arceus, with its thousand arms, then created <a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/palkia#dex-flavor">Palkia</a>(pronounced Pahl-key-uh)- the deity of space, <a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/dialga#dex-flavor">Dialga</a>(pronounced Dee-ahl-guh)- the deity of time, and <a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/giratina#dex-flavor">Giratina</a>(pronounced Gear-uh-teen-uh)- the deity of antimatter.
            It is currently unknown what Arceus' true form is as each time it has been seen and/or caught, it had ended up just being a 
            puppet or part of itself that is more feasible for the human brain to digest.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to legend, there was a small issue with the domain of Giratina. As antimatter kept on destroying the universe. Seemingly as punishment, Arceus banished Giratina to a realm seperate from the human realm known as the distortion world, in which Giratina's anti-matter had gained the ability to only create instead of destroy. This allowed Giratina to practically become the god of the distortion world; its ruler.
            It is also said that whenever an action made in our dimension has certain consequences that happen, the opposite occurs in the distortion world.
            <br> Here is an image of said distortion world for reference:

        <p>This is just a demo of the page and I do not have time to complete it all the way how I want. But I hope it meets the requirements... more or less.</p>
