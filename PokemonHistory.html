             "Listen, one who will face Lysandre… A terribly long time ago… There was a man and a Pokémon. He loved that Pokémon very much. 
             A war began. The man's beloved Pokémon took part in the war. 
             Several years passed. He was given a tiny box. The man wanted to bring the Pokémon back. No matter what it took. 
             The man built a machine to give it life. He brought his beloved Pokémon back. The man had suffered too much. His rage had not subsided.
             He could not forgive the world that had hurt the Pokémon he loved. 
             He turned the machine into the ultimate weapon. The man became a bringer of destruction that ended the war. 
             The Pokémon that was given life must have known… That the lives of many Pokémon were taken to restore its life. The resurrected Pokémon left the man. Get the key back. It should not be used. Everything will vanish again. Do you want to know unending pain…like I have?"<br>

            So, basically, in the past, there was an original dragon. This dragon helped humanity grow and prosper and was passed down through generations of royalty.
            One day, there were twin princes fighting for the throne. One wished for a world where truth would be the primary focus, whereas the other wished for ideals. This split the original dragon.
            One to represent Truth, and one to represent Ideals, leaving behind a husk looking to be whole again.<br>
            <br>These dragons are Reshiram, Zekrom, and Kyurem respectively. In the end, the two princes' fight had destroyed so much that their citizens rose up in a coup and truth and ideals were turned to stones as the husk wandered the earth aimlessly.

            A little bit later on in history, in the ancient Kalos region, 3000 years before the events of the games X and Y, A war was happening.
            The king of that time had a floette which he loved oh so dearly. This floette participated in the war to help her trainer. But, after an amount of time, the floette was sent back to the king in a small box. It had died. The war was still going and this king, wracked with grief, came up with a way to revive his beloved floette. This machine took the lives of other pokemon around his kingdom, most of whom were willingly given to the king to aid in the war. Using the life energy this machine absorbed, it was able to revive the floette. 
            <br><br> Unfortunately, the floette knew what had happened for it to be brought back. And with the war still raging, the floette did not like being brought back. Especially because it took so many innocent lives to do so... So it left. Filled with rage at himself, the war, and the fact that his beloved floette left him, he turned the revival machine into what is now known as The Ultimate Weapon and fired. The beam of light it shot out went up into the sky, coming right back down on the battlefield and ending the war... but it was not without consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
            What the king did not know, was that the beam of light had split the timeline in two. One having mega evolution, the other not. The king was cursed to live forever. Shambling the earth, looking for his floette for as long as he has guilt.
