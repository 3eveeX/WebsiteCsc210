            Hello. Whether you're a seasoned pokemon fan or are just now discovering it, <br> 
            if you are visiting this page, that must mean you are wanting to better understand the <strong>lore</strong>.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            To go to specialized  tabs, you can use the navigation in the top left corner.
            But above, we have the entire pokemon legendary family tree as of generation 9.
            More information about the mythos related to it is found in the <em>General Lore and Mythos</em> tab. While questions about the chronology of the games and the actual in-game timeline can be 
            found in the <em>Game Timeline</em> and <em>In-Game Lore Timeline</em> tabs respectively.
